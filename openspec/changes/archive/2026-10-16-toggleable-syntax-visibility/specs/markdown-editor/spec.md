# Spec Delta: markdown-editor

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Configurable Markdown Syntax Visibility Modes
The system SHALL provide a 3-way toggle control in the formatting toolbar allowing users to switch between three Markdown syntax visibility modes: `auto` (focus), `visible` (raw), and `hidden` (clean), updating Live Preview decorations dynamically and persisting the active mode across editor reloads.

#### Scenario: Switching syntax visibility modes from toolbar
- **WHEN** user clicks the syntax visibility toggle button in the toolbar
- **THEN** the editor cycles to the next visibility mode (`auto` -> `visible` -> `hidden` -> `auto`) and updates the button icon and tooltip accordingly

#### Scenario: Auto mode reveals syntax markers only when cursor is inside the line or word
- **WHEN** syntax visibility mode is set to `auto`
- **THEN** heading prefixes (`### `) and inline formatting markers (`**`, `*`, `~~`, `` ` ``) are hidden by default and only become visible when the cursor is positioned on that line or within that formatted range

#### Scenario: Visible mode displays all syntax markers permanently
- **WHEN** syntax visibility mode is set to `visible`
- **THEN** all raw Markdown syntax markers remain visible throughout the document regardless of cursor position

#### Scenario: Hidden mode conceals syntax markers regardless of cursor position
- **WHEN** syntax visibility mode is set to `hidden`
- **THEN** raw Markdown syntax markers remain concealed even when the user clicks or navigates the cursor through formatted text
